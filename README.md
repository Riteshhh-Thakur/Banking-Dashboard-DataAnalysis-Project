## üß† Business Problems Solved

### 1. üìà **Customer Growth Analysis**
- **Problem:** The bank lacked visibility into client acquisition patterns.
- **Solution:** Monthly and rolling 3-month trends were created using SQL and visualized in Power BI.
- **Insight:** Peak customer acquisition occurred in Q2 across years, with significant drop-offs in Q4.
- **Recommendation:** Reallocate marketing spend to underperforming quarters and strengthen onboarding campaigns post-Q2.

---

### 2. üë• **Customer Segmentation by Income & Loyalty**
- **Problem:** No formal segmentation existed for targeting customers by value.
- **Solution:** Created income bands (Low/Med/High) and linked them with loyalty classification, gender, nationality, and product usage.
- **Insight:** 60% of high-income clients had low product engagement.
- **Recommendation:** Launch cross-selling strategies and loyalty incentives for high-income but under-engaged segments.

---

### 3. üí≥ **Credit Card & Deposit Behavior**
- **Problem:** Limited understanding of product adoption and dormant clients.
- **Solution:** Used SQL + Python to calculate credit card balance contribution, identify zero-deposit clients, and analyze ownership distribution.
- **Insight:** ~25% of customers have zero deposits and low engagement across all products.
- **Recommendation:** Implement retention campaigns and review dormant client criteria for churn prevention.

---

### 4. üßÆ **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Modeling**
- **Problem:** No clear metric to define high-value clients.
- **Solution:** CLV computed using aggregated bank deposits per client.
- **Insight:** Top 10% of clients contributed over 45% of total deposits.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce tiered rewards or exclusive banking services to retain high-CLV clients.

---

### 5. üìâ **Risk & Product Penetration**
- **Problem:** The bank lacked visibility into financial product penetration across risk profiles.
- **Solution:** Analyzed adoption of checking, saving, and foreign currency accounts, segmented by loyalty, risk weighting, and gender.
- **Insight:** Business lending products were underutilized (<10% adoption), even among low-risk segments.
- **Recommendation:** Design tailored lending offers for low-risk, high-income customers with business profiles.
